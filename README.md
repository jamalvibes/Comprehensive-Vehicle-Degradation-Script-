Comprehensive Vehicle Degradation Script

A realistic FiveM vehicle damage and degradation script that enhances immersion by making vehicle damage persistent and meaningful. Severe collisions can disable vehicles, detach wheels, and prevent instant “magic” repairs.

This script is designed to encourage realistic driving and proper mechanical roleplay.
